## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Ebikemotion. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Please read the open issue list in order to find out if your issue is already being addressed by someone of our development team before opening a duplicate. It will save us time.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined the application your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Ebikemotion. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and videos** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can read [this post](https://www.apptamin.com/blog/capture-iphone-ipad-screen-video/) to see how you can capture videos using your own iPhone and a Mac.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Ebikemotion) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Ebikemotion?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Ebikemotion from any Buddybuild email invitation.
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Ebikemotion are you using?** You can get the exact version by going to the **settings** menu and scrolling to the end of the screen.
* **What's the name and version of the iOS you're using**?
